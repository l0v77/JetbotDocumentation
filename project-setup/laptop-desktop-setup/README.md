# Laptop/Desktop Setup

As the logic tier of the project runs on the server (our laptop) side, some packages needs to be installed as prerequisite.

Install the conda environment on your laptop/desktop by following the instruction [here](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html), create an environment and install the following packages

```
pip install numpy matplotlib ....(not finished)
```

OpenCV needs to be installed with a legacy edtion
